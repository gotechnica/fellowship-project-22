                    Hi! I'm <span class="emphasis">Carolyn</span>, a student at the <span class="emphasis">University of Maryland</span> who aspires to be a CEO in the future. I am majoring in chemical engineering and hope to minor in robotics & autonomous systems, and one day build a career where I can use both. Here's a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">my resume</a>.

                <p>
                    I went to Richard Montgomery high school and learned roboticss in FIRST Tech Challenge. In APSCA, I learned basic data strctures, and got introduced to <span class="emphasis">Java</span>. I took a math-heavy courseload that included <span class="emphasis">Multivariable Calculus, Ordinary Differential Equations,</span> and <span class="emphasis">AP BC Calculus</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college, I am taking a variety of STEM classes such as <span class="emphasis">Engineering Design</span> where I learn CAD, and <span class="emphasis">Physics</span> which taught me how the world works the way that it does from a mathematical perspective. I also was able to take immerse myself in business through IBH with classes such as <span class="emphasis">The Future of Work</span>, which explores the future of business and work from a critical and multidisciplinary perspective.
