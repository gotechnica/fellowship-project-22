    <h1>Education</h1>
    <h4>Eleanor Roosevelt High School</h4>
    <p>
    I went to Eleanor Roosevelt High School and partook in multiple advanced placement and accelerated Math, 
    Science, Reading and Computer Science classes. I also partook in the Dual Enrollment Wgich allowed me to get
    get college credit for the Computer Programming (C++), Applied statistics and Probability, and Information Technology classes
    I took at Bowie State University.
    </p>
    <h4>Virginia Tech</h4>
    <p>
    In the fall I will be attending Virginia Tech University as an undergraduate with a major in engineerng. I am going 
    into my freshman year as a general engineering student but I hope to change my major into a mechanical engineering major with
    a minor in computer science.

 <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hey! My name is Allegra Oledibe and I am an aspiring Engineer. I was raised in Rome Italy and my family 
    decided to move to Maryland when I was 9 years old. Academically wise I am mostly involved in my STEM Courses.
    Outside of the academics I was the co-founder of the “Girls who code” chapter at my high school, which is an organization 
    that aims to support and increase the number of women in STEM by equipping them with the tools and skills needed to 
    thrive in the tech field. I also launched a green school initiative that allowed my high school to donate any 
    food scraps to local farms to turn into compost.
    </p>
    <p>
    A fun fact about me is that I'm the type of person that has a thousand different hobbies at once so it's kind of hard to 
    pin point just one thing that I am interested in, but recently I have really been into cooking. I really enjoy researching and finding new recipes 
    from different countries and learning about the cultural aspects of each dish. I also really enjoy eating the food that I get 
    to make!
