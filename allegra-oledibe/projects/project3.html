                    <h2>New-York</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of extended family and friends that live in New-York, so every year for thanksgiving my family 
                        decided to celebrate in New-York. New-York is best known for its busy city atmosphere and its eclectic architecture.
                        New York, often called New York City (NYC) to distinguish it from the State of New York, is the most populous city 
                        in the United States.

                    <h2>Florida</h2>
                    <p>Ive visited Florida once or twice during my summer breaks in school. Florida is best known for its Disney World 
                        location in Orlando and for its tropical "vacation-esque" atmosphere. Florida is a Peninsula- meaning its almost 
                        completely surrounded by water. Its northernost edge is connected to Alabama in the northwest and Georgia in the northeast.
                        Take a swim off Florida's west coast and you'll be in the Gulf of Mexico.

                    <h2>Texas</h2>
                    <p>Though my time in texas was cut short by covid, I think that Texas was one of my favorite states in the U.S. Texas is best 
                        known for its cowboy culture, which is a large part of the state's history and heritage. Cowboys were originally cattle 
                        herders who drove their herds from Texas to markets in other states. You can still see them riding horses in the Texan 
                        countryside. Today, cowboy culture is celebrated in many ways, including rodeos, country music, and cowboy hats and boots.
